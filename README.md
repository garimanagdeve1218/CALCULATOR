# Calculator
Hey There!!<br>
Check this out : A Simple Calculator App!<br>
I built this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Just type in your numbers and operations, and watch it crunch the numbers for you.
It's perfect for quick math problems or when you need to figure something out fast.
And it's super easy to use, no complicated stuff here!
